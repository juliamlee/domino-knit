    <h3> DOMINO KNITTING PATTERN - CALCULATOR</h3>
    <p>The goal of this small calculator is to tell you where to switch colors. Let's pose the problem.</p>
    <p id="ex">Given a knitter is starting with X stitches in a row and the number of stitches decreases by 2 every other row, on what row will the knitter reach half the total number of stitches in the piece.</p>
    <p>The above is a fairly <a href="http://www.knittingdaily.com/blogs/daily/archive/2012/01/11/learn-something-new-domino-knitting.aspx">common pattern</a> for knitters who are completing squares.</p>

    <p>The box below will allow you to enter the number of stitches in your initial row.</p>
    <p>An example will help us understand exactly what is happening. For instance you could say the initial row will be 59 stitches wide. This means you'll start with 2 rows of 59, then two rows of 57 and so on. This will mean on the 16th row you will hit your 900th stitch, which is half of the total amount of stitches which would be 1800.</p>
    <p>Why is this helpful? Often using the domino knitting pattern one will want to find the half point of the total number of stitches, where they can switch colors. So in the above example, the first 900 stitches could be in one colour, and the second 900 stitches could be another.</p>
    <p>Go ahead and try different row numbers to see where your half point is:</p>

    <form>
        <textarea name="d" id="rowNum">42</textarea>
    </form>

    <h4>You're going to have a total of <div id="answerStitch">____</div> stitches</h4>
    <h4>At stitch #<div id="stitchNum">__</div> on row <div id="rowAnswer">__</div> you should switch colors</h4>
